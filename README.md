# C
It is pivotal for programmers to begin learning 'low level' languages. Even though C is not considered a low level language, it is lower than python, javascript, c# etc.
This is my repository for small simple programs to hopefully begin building projects in C, because why not

This project will hold programs for creating data structures in C as i design them, along with that, this serves as a repository to help learn whats happening assembly wise on my intel chip. (sorry ARM people)
